# TablexIcons
Port of [tabler-icons](https://tabler.io/icons) to a Linux icon pack

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e65fb15b-3fe7-40fb-a037-24820d51de36)


This project maps the icons from [tabler-icons](https://tabler.io/icons) into a KDE/freedesktop/Linux icon theme, for a clean and modern Linux experience.

# Contributing

The mapping will not be 100% complete, so some icons will be missing. Contributions to the `generate.json` file are welcome, simply add the KDE icon name as well as the tabler icon name to the file and submit a pull request.

# Credits

All of the icons in this pack were made by [tabler-icons](https://github.com/tabler/tabler-icons) under the MIT license.  
This project simply maps them for use as an icon theme.
